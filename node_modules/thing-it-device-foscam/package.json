It allows to\n* View an up-to-date snapshot of the camera. This is a very useful, lightweight feature\nto quickly see the status of the area under surveillance without requiring full video streaming.\nThis works excellent on mobile devices even in areas with low bandwith.\n* Watch a live video stream.\n* Control the camera position, if the camera has pan/tilt features.\n* Save a camera position and restore to it.\n* Include the camera into complex scenarios and orchestrate multiple devices.\n* Remote access to your Foscam camera and other devices from everywhere over the Internet.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequesites\n* You need a Foscam camera, connected to the same network as your [thing-it-node].\nAs with all devices you can simulate Foscam cameras if you want to get an understanding\nof the functionality without the hardware.\n* The standard Foscam streaming does not require any additional installation.\n* If you want HLS and webM live streaming from your Foscam camera you will need\n [FFmpeg and FFserver](https://www.ffmpeg.org) installed on your node box. You can download the\n FFmpeg and FFserver versions for your node box [here](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html).\n Make sure the FFmpeg and FFserver executables are in the path. In case the frequent image\n snapshots are enough for you, FFmpeg and FFserver installation is not needed.\n\n### Installation\nAuto Dicovery Option:\n[thing-it] can auto-discover your Foscam camera under the following conditions:\n * The camera is on the same network as your node box.\n * Your camera listens on port 80 which is standard for Foscam cameras.\n * Your camera either has the standard Foscam user \"admin\" with a blank\n   password or you added a user \"thingit\" with password \"[th1ng-1t]\". Operator\n   access level is sufficient.\n * If auto-discovery doesn't work\n    * Check the node box's log for error messages.\n    * Try to ping the camera from the node box and if successful, restart\n      your [thing-it] node.\n\nIf the above conditions aren't met or you don't want to use auto discovery, the\nfollowing steps allow you to explicitly configure your Foscam device:\n* Configure or copy a [thing-it] Mesh.\n* Add a Foscam device.\n* Configure the Foscam device by providing:\n    * The Foscam host, i.e. the IP address of your Foscam camera.\n    * The port your Foscam camera is listening on. If no port is provided\n    the plugin will try to connect against port 80.\n    * A user name for your Foscam camera as configured via the Foscam\n    management interface. If no user name is provided the plugin will\n    use 'admin'.\n    * The password for the user provided above. If no password is provided\n    the device will leave the password blank.\n    * The update time of the snapshot image. This determines how frequent\n    the device will request and display a current image of the camera. The\n    default is 2000ms.\n    * HLS Live Streaming determines if HLS streaming is to be enabled.\n    The default value is false. If enabled a ffmpeg installation is required\n    on the node box.\n    * webM Live Streaming determines if webM streaming is to be enabled.\n    The default value is false. If enabled FFmpeg and FFserver installation\n    are required on the node box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
