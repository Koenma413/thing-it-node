  "readme": "# thing-it-device-z-wave\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/thing-it-device-z-wave.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/thing-it-device-z-wave/)\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm-dl/thing-it-device-z-wave.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/thing-it-device-z-wave/)\n\n[thing-it-node] Device Plugin for arbitrary Z-Wave networks and their devices.\n\nThis allows you to \n\n* control Z-Wave-enabled devices over the Internet,\n* define complex scenes, storyboards and timer controlled execution \n\nby means of [thing-it-node](https://github.com/marcgille/thing-it-node) and [thing-it.com](http://www.thing-it.com).\n\nAs you can combine Z-Wave devices with other devices and can orchestrate scenarios across locations, this goes far beyond what\nZ-Wave networks allow you to do with scenes and alerts.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Installation of Open Z-Wave\n\n#### Linux\n\nThe [thing-it] team is testing with a Aeon Labs Z-Wave Z-Stick Series 2 USB Dongle. Most Linux distributions such as Raspbian Jessie\nrequire no driver installation. [thing-it] expects the USB stick to be found at \"/dev/ttyUSB0\".\n\nYou will need to ensure the OpenZWave library and headers are installed first. You can do this one of two ways:\n\n* Downloading the source tarball from the [OpenZWave repository](https://github.com/OpenZWave/open-zwave/releases) and then compiling it and installing on your system via **make** and **sudo make install**.\n* You could also install OpenZWave via a precompiled package that's suitable for your Linux distribution and architecture. Notice: Be sure to install BOTH the binary (libopenzwave-x.y) AND the development package (libopenzwave-dev).\n\n#### OSX\n\nThe [thing-it] team is testing with a Aeon Labs Z-Wave Z-Stick Series 2 USB Dongle. On Mac OSX this dongle\nrequires the installation of a driver which can be found on the support section of Aeon Lab's\n[website](http://aeotec.com/support). [thing-it] is going to try to communicate with the driver via\n\"/dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART\".\n\nYou will need to ensure the OpenZWave library and headers are installed first. You can do this one of two ways:\n\n* Downloading the source tarball from the [OpenZWave repository](https://github.com/OpenZWave/open-zwave/releases) and then compiling it and installing on your system via **make** and **sudo make install**.\n* You could also install OpenZWave via a precompiled package that's suitable for your Linux distribution and architecture. Notice: Be sure to install BOTH the binary (libopenzwave-x.y) AND the development package (libopenzwave-dev).\n\nIf an error related to pkg-config occurs during the build process, perform the following steps and try again.\n* brew uninstall pkg-config\n* brew install pkg-config\n* brew unlink pkg-config && brew link pkg-config\n\n#### Windows\n\nSince there is no standard installation location for Open Z-Wave on Windows, it will be automatically downloaded, compiled, and installed when you install \n**openzwave-shared** via **npm** *(see below)*.\n\n### Installation of NodeJS and [thing-it-node]\n\nFirst, install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your computer (e.g. your PC or your Raspberry Pi).\n\nThen install **[thing-it-node]** via\n\n```\nnpm install -g thing-it-node\n```\n \n### Initialization and Start of [thing-it-node] \n\nThe **[thing-it-device-z-wave]** Plugin is installed with **[thing-it-node]**, hence there is no need to install it separately.\n\nThe Plugin supports Autodiscovery for an existing Z-Wave network and its devices, hence you only have to create a directory in which you intend to run the configuration, e.g.\n \n```\nmkdir ~/hue-test\ncd ~/hue-test\n```\n\nand invoke\n\n```\ntin init\n```\n\nand then start **[thing-it-node]** via\n\n```\ntin run\n```\n\nInstall the **thing-it Mobile App** from the Apple Appstore or Google Play and set it up to connect to **[thing-it-node]** \nlocally as described [here](https://thing-it.com/thing-it/#/documentationPanel/mobileClient/connectionModes) or just connect your browser under \n[http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).\n \n### Z-Wave Setup\n\nProcure a Z-Wave USB Stick e.g. the (Aeonlab Z-Stick)[http://aeotec.com/z-wave-usb-stick] and connect it to the USB port of your node computer. Make sure that\nyou have the latest driver installed and identify the device the stick is connected to.\n\nExamples are:\n\n* **/dev/ttyUSB0** on Linux/Mac OS or\n* **/dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART** on Linux/Mac OS or\n* **\\\\\\\\.\\\\COM3** on Windows.\n\nFollow the instructions for your stick to pair Z-Wave devices.\n\nIf you start **[thing-it-node]** after configuring your Z-Wave network will automatically add all Z-Wave devices to your **[thing-it-node]** Configuration and \nyou will be able control these from the **[thing-it] Mobile App** immediately.\n\n## Mobile UI\n\nThe following screenshot shows the Node Page of the [sample configuration](\"./examples.configuration\"):\n\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"./documentation/images/mobile-ui.png\"><img src=\"./documentation/images/mobile-ui.png\" width=\"70%\" height=\"70%\"></a></p>\n\n## Where to go from here ...\n\nAfter completing the above, you may be interested in\n\n* Configuring additional [Devices](https://www.thing-it.com/thing-it/#/documentationPanel/mobileClient/deviceConfiguration), \n[Groups](https://www.thing-it.com/thing-it/#/documentationPanel/mobileClient/groupConfiguration), \n[Services](https://www.thing-it.com/thing-it/#/documentationPanel/mobileClient/serviceConfiguration), \n[Event Processing](https://www.thing-it.com/thing-it/#/documentationPanel/mobileClient/eventConfiguration), \n[Storyboards](https://www.thing-it.com/thing-it/#/documentationPanel/mobileClient/storyboardConfiguration) and \n[Jobs](https://www.thing-it.com/thing-it/#/documentationPanel/mobileClient/jobConfiguration) via your **[thing-it] Mobile App**.\n* Use [thing-it.com](https://www.thing-it.com) to safely connect your Node Box from everywhere, manage complex configurations, store and analyze historical data \nand offer your configurations to others on the **[thing-it] Mesh Market**.\n* Explore other Device Plugins like [Texas Instruments Sensor Tag](https://www.npmjs.com/package/thing-it-device-ti-sensortag), [Plugwise Smart Switches](https://www.npmjs.com/package/thing-it-device-plugwise) and many more. For a full set of \nDevice Plugins search for **thing-it-device** on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). Or [write your own Plugins](https://github.com/marcgille/thing-it-node/wiki/Plugin-Development-Concepts).\n",
